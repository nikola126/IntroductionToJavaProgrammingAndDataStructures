Wells Fargo Championship: Rory McIlroy starts well as Jason Day leads

"It could have been 65 or a 64," said McIlroy. "It's still a good start."

McIlroy made a double-bogey on his 13th hole of the day at TPC Potomac in Maryland, in the USA, but found two late birdies and added: "That was a nice bounce back to birdie both of those holes. I said to myself walking off the green, if I could just get back to three under by the end of the day after that, I would be pretty happy.

"I think that in the first week back after three weeks off, there are maybe going to be a couple of mistakes in there."

McIlroy - who has won the event three times - is tied for 17th.

Australia's Day won the tournament in 2018 in what was the last of his 12 wins on the PGA Tour.

The 34-year-old has slipped from being world number one in 2016 to a rank of 127 at the start of this week's event.

He dropped one shot all day and hit eight birdies, leaving him a shot clear of American Joel Dahmen.
